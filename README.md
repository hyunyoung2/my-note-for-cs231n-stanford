# My not for [CS231n of Stanford](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/)

After I finished taking this class, cs231n through [Youtube(2017)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT1JzLTH4G4&list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv) and [Youtube(2016)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL70hhrN6k0-CmnEhCnZLVP_0d9XH3edXW), Irealized I need to orgarnize this class note for me. 

From now on, I would repeat this class one more time.

As soon as I finish one class, I would organize what I learn into this respository. 

If you want to know about Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning, take this class, [cs231n of stanford](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/)
