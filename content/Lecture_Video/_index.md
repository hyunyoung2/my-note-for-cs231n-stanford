My note for [cs231n : Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition of stanford](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/)

They are give you lecture video of 2017 version for people out of stanford. 

So I would study with that youtube, Because I have already heard of the youtube 0f 2016 version. 

This is just for review on my deep learning once again with 2016 and 2017 or 2018.
