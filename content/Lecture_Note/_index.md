My note for [cs231n : Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition of stanford](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/)

They are give you lecture video of 2017 version for people out of stanford. 

So I would study with [course note](http://cs231n.github.io/) on CS231N, Because I have already heard of the youtube 0f 2016 version. 

This is just for review on my deep learning once again.
